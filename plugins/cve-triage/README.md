# CVE Triage Skill

A security skill for triaging CVE vulnerabilities using NIST NVD and CISA KEV data.

## What It Does

- Queries NIST NVD API for CVEs by product name or CVE ID
- Cross-references results against the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog
- Computes SLA deadlines per CISA BOD 22-01
- Produces a prioritized remediation report

## Installation

Copy this plugin directory or install via the plugin system:

```bash
# Copy to your skills directory
cp -r plugins/cve-triage ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Usage

### Natural Language

- "Find CVEs for Windows 11"

/triage windows 11
/triage CVE-2024-21351
