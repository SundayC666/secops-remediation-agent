# CISA BOD 22-01 SLA Policy

Reference: [CISA Binding Operational Directive 22-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities)

## SLA Definitions

KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) status takes priority over CVSS severity.

| Condition | SLA (Days) | Description | Reference |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| KEV (CVE >= 2021) | 14 | Actively exploited, assigned 2021 or later | BOD 22-01: Two weeks for recent KEV |
| KEV (CVE < 2021) | 180 | Actively exploited, assigned before 2021 | BOD 22-01: Six months for legacy KEV |
| CRITICAL | 15 | CVSS 9.0-10.0, not in KEV | Industry standard |
| HIGH | 30 | CVSS 7.0-8.9, not in KEV | PCI-DSS / Industry standard |
| MEDIUM | 90 | CVSS 4.0-6.9, not in KEV | Industry standard |
| LOW | 180 | CVSS 0.1-3.9, not in KEV | Industry standard |

## Priority Ranking

Lower number = higher priority.

| Priority | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | KEV + CRITICAL |
| 2 | KEV + HIGH |
| 3 | KEV + MEDIUM |
| 4 | KEV + LOW |
| 5 | CRITICAL (non-KEV) |
| 6 | HIGH (non-KEV) |
| 7 | MEDIUM (non-KEV) |
| 8 | LOW (non-KEV) |

## Status Thresholds

| Status | SLA Remaining |
|--------|--------------|
| On Track | > 50% remaining |
| Due Soon | 25-50% remaining |
| Overdue | 0% (SLA breached) |

## Overdue Actions

When SLA is breached:
- Escalate to management
- If remediation cannot be accomplished, remove asset from network per CISA guidance
