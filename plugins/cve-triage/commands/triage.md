# Triage CVE Vulnerabilities

Invoke the cve-triage skill to look up and prioritize vulnerabilities.

If given a product name (e.g., "windows 11", "nginx", "chrome"), search NVD for recent CVEs affecting that product.

If given a CVE ID (e.g., "CVE-2024-12345"), look up that specific vulnerability.

## Steps

1. Determine if the argument is a CVE ID (matches `CVE-\d{4}-\d+`) or a product name.

2. Run the NVD lookup:
```bash
uv run {baseDir}/skills/cve-triage/scripts/nvd_lookup.py --product "$ARGUMENTS"
```
Or for a CVE ID:
```bash
uv run {baseDir}/skills/cve-triage/scripts/nvd_lookup.py --cve "$ARGUMENTS"
```

3. Extract all CVE IDs from the results and check against CISA KEV:
```bash
uv run {baseDir}/skills/cve-triage/scripts/kev_check.py --cve-ids "<comma-separated-ids>"
```

4. Compute SLA deadlines per CISA BOD 22-01 (see `references/sla-policy.md`).

5. Present a prioritized triage report sorted by: KEV status > CVSS severity > publication date.
